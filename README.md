# vscode-portfolio
This is a forked version of vscode-portfolio. I have added few features and deleted some pages according to my need.
The things that I've added are:

- Changed about.html to a page that presents a basic information about who I am. And also a link to my resume.
- Removed the necessity of github token. Now you can use this template without any token.
- Added server.js to run the website and host it in any kind of server that you want with 'node server.js' command.
- Implemented SSL certificate to the website. Now you can use this template with https. Please make sure that you have a valid SSL certificate and required files in the same directory given in .env file.
